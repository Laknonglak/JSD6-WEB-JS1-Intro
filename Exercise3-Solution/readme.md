#### Exercise 3

You want to build a page that says "Hello name". 
Underneath the text will be a button that says, "Change the name!". 
When someone clicks the button, a prompt should pop up and ask, "What is your name?". 
The person is able to input a name into the prompt and the new text of the page should say, "Hello {inputted name}".
Make sure to use the built in **prompt()** function to get the name. Hint: Use the DOM API to update the name.
